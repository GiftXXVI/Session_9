					## üõ°ROLE BASED ACCESS CONTROL
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### What is RBAC?
					- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of
					individual users
					- With RBAC, you can enforce security policy at a more fine-grained level. RBAC uses the security
					principle of **least privilege**.
					- **Least privilege** means that a user has precisely the amount of
					privilege that is necessary to perform a job.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### RBAC Terms
					- Scope: Defines where the role can work
					- Role: A special identity for running privileged applications. It is also a collection of
					permissions
					that you can apply to users. This special identity can be assumed by assigned users only.
					- Permissions: What the users are allowed to do i.e read:articles, delete:articles
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Benefits of RBAC
					- create systematic, repeatable assignment of permissions
					- easily audit user privileges and correct identified issues
					- quickly add and change roles, as well as implement them across APIs
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Benefits of RBAC
					- cut down on the potential for error when assigning user permissions
					- integrate third-party users by giving them predefined roles
					- more effectively comply with regulatory and statutory requirements for confidentiality and privacy
					**We had an implementation in [üîóSession 7](https://github.com/GiftXXVI/S7_Notebook)**

					## üí£Alternative Attack Vectors
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### The Weakest Link
					**After you have secured your application, bad actors will go for the weakest link in your system
					and that is the user.**
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### SOCIAL ENGINEERING
					- Social engineering attacks use a combination of psychological manipulation and malware to gain
					access to systems or data or to gain elevated access to the system or its sensitive data.
					**Here is an interactive [üîóDemo](https://www.cssia.org/social_engineering/)**
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### PHISHING
					- Phishing is a kind of social engineering attack where a bad actor sends an email purporting to be
					from a legitimate source that tricks the user into providing sensitive information.
					**Here is an interactive [üîóDemo](https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/email-spoofing)**
